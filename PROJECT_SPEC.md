# Product Requirements Document (MVP) for NYC Services GPT

## 1. Objective

Deliver a one-stop helper over NYC Open Data / DSS docs that lets users self-serve without human intervention.

## 2. Primary KPI

- **Self-Service Success Rate**
    - **Definition:** % of user queries fully answered (no fallback to human support or "I don't know" response).
    - **Baseline Measurement (Week 0):** Conduct 100-query pilot using synthetic seed set; expect ~50â€“60%.
    - **MVP Target:** â‰¥ 90% by Day 14 post-launch.

## 3. Out-of-Scope for MVP

- **Time-to-Answer:** average elapsed time per query
- **Page-Click Reduction:** # of pages/sites visited before resolution

*(These will be captured in later iterations after the core self-serve flow is solid.)*

## 4. Persona Example

- **Name:** Maria the Microâ€‘Entrepreneur
- **Background:** Single mother running a pop-up cafÃ©; unfamiliar with NYC licensing.
- **Needs:** Plainâ€‘language answers about permits & benefits in â‰¤20 sec.
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Given a question about "food cart permit," the agent returns 3 relevant steps with links, â‰¥90% accuracy.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria (for KPI)

- Run a 100-query pilot sample â‰¥ Day 14.
- â‰¥ 90 of those queries must be correctly answered endâ€‘toâ€‘end without human fallback.

## 6. Baseline Measurement Protocol

1. Assemble **100 synthetic queries** across top 5 services.
2. Run them through the RAG pipeline without any promptâ€‘tuning.
3. Annotate each response as "Correct" or "Needs Human."
4. Compute baseline Self-Service Success Rate = (#Correct / 100) Ã— 100.
