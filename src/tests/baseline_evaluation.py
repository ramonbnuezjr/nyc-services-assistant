Baseline Evaluation for NYC Services GPT RAG System

This module runs the 100-query baseline evaluation to measure the current
Self-Service Success Rate. It uses the synthetic queries from PROJECT_SPEC.md
across 5 NYC services: Unemployment, SNAP, Medicaid, Cash Assistance, Child Care.

The evaluation measures retrieval accuracy and provides insights for achieving
the ≥ 90% Self-Service Success Rate KPI.
