## Session: 2025-08-06 Chunker Complete
**Goal:** Finalize and test `chunker.py`  
**Outcome:** All unit tests passing; module ready for integration.  
**Prompt Used:** "Generate chunk_documents with overlap + simple tokenizer + pytest."  
**Next Action:** Scaffold `data_processor.py` to wire chunker → embeddings → vector store.

## Session: 2025-08-06 Data Processor Scaffolded
**Goal:** Create data processor to wire chunker into embeddings pipeline  
**Outcome:** Complete implementation with 19 passing tests, ready for vector store integration  
**Prompt Used:** "Scaffold data_processor.py with process_documents function that reads files/text, calls chunker, generates embeddings, returns structured records with metadata. Include comprehensive pytest suite with mocks."  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `src/ingest/data_processor.py` with `process_documents()` function
- Integrated with existing `chunk_documents()` for tokenized splitting
- Added mockable `EmbeddingClient` class for OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- Returns structured records: `{"text": str, "embedding": List[float], "metadata": {...}}`
- Supports both file paths and raw text inputs
- Includes comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_data_processor.py`) with 19 tests
- All tests passing, demo functionality working
- Ready for 100-query evaluation targeting ≥ 90% Self-Service Success Rate
**Next Action:** Implement vector store integration and RAG pipeline end-to-end testing
