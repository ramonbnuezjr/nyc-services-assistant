# Activity Log

*This file will be used to log commits and prompts during the development process.*

## Session: 2025-08-06 Chunker Complete
**Goal:** Finalize and test `chunker.py`  
**Outcome:** All unit tests passing; module ready for integration.  
**Prompt Used:** "Generate chunk_documents with overlap + simple tokenizer + pytest."  
**Next Action:** Scaffold `data_processor.py` to wire chunker → embeddings → vector store.

## Session: 2025-08-06 Data Processor Scaffolded
**Goal:** Create data processor to wire chunker into embeddings pipeline  
**Outcome:** Complete implementation with 19 passing tests, ready for vector store integration  
**Prompt Used:** "Scaffold data_processor.py with process_documents function that reads files/text, calls chunker, generates embeddings, returns structured records with metadata. Include comprehensive pytest suite with mocks."  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `src/ingest/data_processor.py` with `process_documents()` function
- Integrated with existing `chunk_documents()` for tokenized splitting
- Added mockable `EmbeddingClient` class for OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- Returns structured records: `{"text": str, "embedding": List[float], "metadata": {...}}`
- Supports both file paths and raw text inputs
- Includes comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_data_processor.py`) with 19 tests
- All tests passing, demo functionality working
- Ready for 100-query evaluation targeting ≥ 90% Self-Service Success Rate
**Next Action:** Implement vector store integration and RAG pipeline end-to-end testing

## Session: 2025-08-06 Vector Store Implemented
**Goal:** Create storage-agnostic vector store interface for document retrieval  
**Outcome:** Complete implementation with 24 passing tests, ready for RAG pipeline integration  
**Prompt Used:** "Implement src/retrieve/vector_store.py with init_vector_store, add_documents, query_vector_store functions. Keep interface storage-agnostic, add comprehensive tests with mocks."  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `src/retrieve/vector_store.py` with `VectorStore` class
- Implemented `init_vector_store()`, `add_documents()`, `query_vector_store()` functions
- Used ChromaDB backend with storage-agnostic design for easy migration
- Added comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_vector_store.py`) with 24 tests
- Included KPI metadata tracking for Self-Service Success Rate ≥ 90%
- Support metadata filtering for service-specific queries
- Added collection statistics and management functions
- Demo functionality shows readiness for 100-query evaluation
- All tests passing, vector store working with real ChromaDB
**Next Action:** Integrate data processor + vector store for end-to-end RAG pipeline testing

## Session: 2025-08-06 RAG Pipeline Integration Complete
**Goal:** Wire together data processor and vector store for end-to-end pipeline validation  
**Outcome:** Complete integration with 8 passing tests, ready for 100-query baseline evaluation  
**Prompt Used:** "Create integration test that processes documents through full pipeline and validates retrieval accuracy for 100-query evaluation set."  
**Implementation Details:**
- Created `tests/test_rag_pipeline_integration.py` with comprehensive integration tests
- Wired together data processor and vector store for complete pipeline validation
- Test document processing: ingestion → chunking → embedding → storage → retrieval
- Included 100-query simulation with NYC services from PROJECT_SPEC.md
- Added metadata filtering tests for service-specific queries
- Test error handling and performance characteristics
- Included KPI tracking tests for Self-Service Success Rate ≥ 90%
- All 8 integration tests passing, pipeline ready for baseline evaluation
- Validates retrieval accuracy for 100-query evaluation set
**Next Action:** Run baseline evaluation with 100 synthetic queries to measure Self-Service Success Rate
