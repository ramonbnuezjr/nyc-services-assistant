End-to-End RAG Pipeline Integration Tests

This module tests the complete RAG pipeline by wiring together the data processor
and vector store components. It validates retrieval accuracy for the 100-query
evaluation set targeting ≥ 90% Self-Service Success Rate KPI.

The integration test processes documents through the full pipeline:
1. Document ingestion → chunking → embedding generation
2. Vector store storage and retrieval
3. Query processing and relevance validation
