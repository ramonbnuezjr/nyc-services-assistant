Request a fair hearing within 60 days of the decision. This is important as requests made after this period may not be considered.\n2. You can make this request in several ways:\n   - Online: Visit the relevant government website to submit your request.\n   - By phone: Call the appropriate government service number.\n   - In writing: Write a letter detailing your appeal and send it to the relevant government office.\n3. You may continue receiving benefits during the appeal process. This means your assistance won't be cut off while your appeal is being considered.\n\nUnfortunately, the documents do not provide specific contact information or the website to request a fair hearing.
